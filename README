Pre-requisites in addition to cmake, extra-cmake-modules, g++ and so on
Package names for Debian and its derivatives such as Ubuntu:

1. python3-ply (PLY from http://www.dabeaz.com/ply).
   
2. qt5-qmake
   
3. qtbase5-dev
   
4. sip-dev
    
5. Access to PyQt5 sip files

Note: argvalidate in kbindinggenerator is a slightly modified copy of
argvalidate originally from https://bitbucket.org/sp/python-argvalidate.

6. We assume the kf5 source and an appropriate directory layout like this:
   
     .../source
         frameworks
             kitemmodels
             ...
         pykde5
             cmake
             sip
         pyqt5
         twine2
             kf5.py
             ...
     .../build
         frameworks
         pykde5
         pyqt5
         ...

Note: the pyqt5 will typically be a link to somethng like PyQt-gpl-5.4.1
which is the form currently used by Riverbank for PyQt.

7. Configure and build like this:
  
   cd .../build/frameworks/kitemmodels
   cmake ../../../source/frameworks/kitemmodels
   cd ../../build/pyqt5
   python ../../source/pyqt5/configure.py --qmake /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/bin/qmake
   cd ../../build/pykde5
   ../../source/twine2/kf5.py
